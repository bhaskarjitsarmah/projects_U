By looking a the multi-line string, we notice that even though all the phone numbers have different digits, they all have the same pattern, namely, 3 digits followed by a single charater, followed by 3 more digits, followed by another single character, followed by 4 digits. We will take advantage of this, to find all the phone numbers by combining the special sequence \\\\d and the dot (`.`) metcharacter, as shown in the code below:"

For example, the regular expression \\[^6-9\\] will match any charcter that is not 6,7,8, or 9. Similarly, the regular expression \\[^a-zA-Z\\] will match any character that is not a lowercase or uppercase letter. \n",
