    "In the code below, we have a multi-line string with the names of the 4 highest mountains in the world according to Wikipedia. \n",
    "Let's create a regular expressions that allow us to find the names the names of these mountains. The first to notice is that the word mountain has been abbreviated in two different ways, as `Mt.` and as `Mt` (without the period). Therefore, if we want to find all the names of the mountains we need to create a regular expression that allows us to indicate that the period in the abbreviation as optional. We can do this by using the `?` metacharacter. The `?` will match 0 or 1 repetitions of the preceding regular expression. For example, the regular expression `'Mt\\.?'` will match either `Mt` or `Mt.`, as shown below:"

    "We can clearly see that we get the two different abbreviations. Now let's continue creating our regular expression so that it can match all the mountain names. To do this, we notice that the next character after the abbreviation is a whitespace, therefore, the next sequence in our regex is going to be \\\\s. After that whitespace, we have the name of mountain. We can see that the first letter in all the names is an uppercase letter, so we will use the character set \\[A-Z\\] to math any possible uppercase letter. Then comes the tricky part. We see that all the mountain names are of different lengths but only contain alphanumeric characters. To match any alphanumeric character we will the sequence \\\\w as we saw before and to help us match names of any length we will use the `*` metacharcter. The `*` metacharcter, matches 0 or more repetitions of the preceding regular expression (as many repetitions as are possible). For example, `ab*` will match `a` or `a` followed by any number of `b`s, such as `ab` or `abbbbb`. Let's put all this together to see how it works:"

Write a regular expression that is able to find all these email addresses. Then use the `.finditer()` method to find the regex in the `sample_text` string. Finally, write a loop to print the `matches`.\n",

    "**HINT :** First we notice that all the characters before the `@` symbol only contain lowercase letters, undersocores, and numbers. To match this part of the email address we can use the charcters set `\\[a-z_0-9\\]` followed by the `+` metacharcter, to account for the fact that all email addresses must have at least one character or more beofre the `@` symbol. The `+` metacharcter matches 1 or more repetitions of the preceding regular expression. For exmaple, `ab+` will match `a` followed by any non-zero number of `b`s, but it will not match just `a`.\n",

Then we notice that the domain names contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, undersocres, and dashes. Again we can use the charcters set `\\[a-zA-Z_-\\]` followed by the `+` metacharcter, to account for the fact that all domains must have at least one character or more after the `@` symbol. To match the first dot, (`.`), we need to escape it first using the backslah, (`\\.`) because the dot is a metacharcter. We can then use the character set `\\[a-z\\]+` to match either `com`, `edu`, or `gov`.\n",
